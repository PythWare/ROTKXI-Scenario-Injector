The Python script is for enabling and disabling Scenario mods for the PS2 version of Romance Of The Three Kingdoms XI. Credit goes to God(Christian) and myself for the coding.

To use it you need Python 3 installed, the SAN11RES.BIN file(to get the file you need to mount the iso file and copy it and paste into a directory of your choice) in the same folder as the Python script, and the iso file(rename the game's iso file to ROTKXI.iso).

For applying a mod you need to drag and drop the mod file onto the Python script and type "apply" in the command prompt. For disabling a mod double click the script and type "disable". You can also disable a mod by opening the command prompt, typing the script file's name, pressing enter, and then typing "disable" if you prefer.
