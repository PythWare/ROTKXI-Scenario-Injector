The Python script is for enabling and disabling Scenario mods for the PS2 version of Romance Of The Three Kingdoms XI. Credit goes to God(Christian) and myself for the coding.

To use it you need Python 3 installed, the SAN11RES.BIN file in the same folder as the Python script, and the iso file(rename the game's iso file to ROTKXI.iso).
